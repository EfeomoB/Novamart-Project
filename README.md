NovaMart Capstone Project – Customer & Product Insights
Overview

NovaMart, a Nigerian subscription-based company, struggled with unclear bundle profitability, failed payments, scattered feedback, and no customer segmentation. This project used SQL and Power BI to uncover insights and deliver data-driven recommendations that improved retention, revenue, and efficiency.

Tools & Technologies

SQL – Business question analysis & KPI extraction

Power BI – Interactive dashboards & storytelling

PostgreSQL – Database hosting & queries

Business Challenges

No visibility into bundle profitability

No customer segmentation or churn analysis

Failed & pending payments distorted revenue tracking

Scattered customer feedback & ticket ratings

Lack of standardized KPIs for monitoring

Key Insights

Top Bundles – Certain bundles dominated revenue while others underperformed

Customer Loyalty – High-tier customers spent more, but mid-tier showed churn risk

Payment Failures – Linked to specific methods, reducing revenue accuracy

Regional Trends – Few cities drove most subscriptions

Feedback Issues – Unresolved complaints led to poor ratings & churn

Recommendations

Focus marketing on top bundles, restructure weak ones

Create loyalty programs & retention strategies for mid-tier customers

Improve payment reliability & failure-handling processes

Expand into underperforming cities using top-city playbooks

Enhance support resolution to boost satisfaction & retention

Standardize KPIs (ARPU, churn, bundle profitability, payment success)
